[00:17.53] In the dark, we come out and play
[00:21.55] We are it's child, here to stay
[00:25.33] Running through, hungry for strays
[00:29.42] No invitat-, take me away
[00:41.92] 
[00:33.44] I'm not cruel, still what you see
[00:37.40] Club to club, city with me
[00:41.30] Hungry for life, 'out your pity
[00:45.41] I don't want it, you give it
[00:59.41] 
[01:05.52] Still can't say she won't start up
[01:09.34] Still can't say she won't start up a fight
[01:13.39] You go city
[01:16.88] 'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait
[01:42.88] 
[01:21.78] In the dark, a killer await
[01:25.55] To kill a life, life you make
[01:29.30] You do another, death can live
[01:33.53] Just keep on dancing, movie you're in (I'm not cruel)
[02:00.03] 
[01:37.64] The smell of your sweat, lures me in
[01:41.47] Your heart', things to me
[01:45.59] Running feet, through my blood
[01:49.58] My ghost inside you soon will be
[02:05.58] 
[01:53.30] Still can't say she won't start up
[01:57.49] Still can't say she won't start up a fight
[02:01.46] You go city
[02:04.94] 'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait
[02:30.94] 
[02:08.79] Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat- your pity
[02:12.59] Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat- your pity
[02:16.73] Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat- your pity
[02:20.50] Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat- your pity
[02:49.00] 
[02:24.66] Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat- your pity
[02:28.50] Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat- your pity
[02:32.67] Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat- your pity
[02:36.59] Hungry for strays, hungry for life, no invitat- your pity
[03:05.09] 
[02:53.74] I don't want sex, but you give it
[03:10.24] 
[02:57.30] Still can't say she won't start up
[03:01.31] Still can't say she won't start up a fight
[03:05.59] You go city
[03:08.71] 'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait
[03:34.71] 
[03:13.62] Still can't say she won't start up
[03:17.30] Still can't say she won't start up a fight
[03:21.33] You go city
[03:24.95] 'Cause in the city of life she can't, she can't wait
[03:50.95] 
[03:29.40] Now it's over, you've taken your life
[03:33.42] Dark grows thin and I'm left to hide
[03:37.42] I don't regret it, but it's sad anyway
[03:41.45] Now we're both dead and scared of the black
[04:02.95] 
[03:45.62] This life of games and diligent trust
[03:49.36] It's the things we do, or the things we must
[03:53.60] I'm now tired of being cussed
[03:57.69] So go sleep forever end to dust
