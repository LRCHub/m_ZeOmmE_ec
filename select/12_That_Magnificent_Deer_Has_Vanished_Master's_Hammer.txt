Master's Hammer
The Jilemnice Occultist (Storyline)
That Magnificent Deer Has Vanished In The Bush
In the morning Satrapold calls Blether, the head groom of the castle's
Stables, and tells him to saddle up a new horse. The same day the two
Of them are going to go to Spiritus' inn., the occultist' nest; they
Do so in disguise so that nobody will recognize them. (This is a new
Technique of espionage.) Satrapold is shocked by Calamaria's presence
In the public house, where she serves spirits. With the wave
Magic wand the Captain's consciousness vanishes and his body and soul
Are flooded with an emotion completely opposed to the desire to
Obliterate spiritism in the Krkonose slopes.
